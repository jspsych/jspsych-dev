# Tools & Templates for jsPsych development

This repository is for jsPsych users who would like to develop their own plugins, extensions or shareable timelines (jsPsych experiments). We provide these three tools under the `/packages` folder for each of these purposes:

- [`@jspsych/new-plugin`](https://github.com/jspsych/jspsych-dev/tree/main/packages/new-plugin)
- [`@jspsych/new-extension`](https://github.com/jspsych/jspsych-dev/tree/main/packages/new-extension)
- [`@jspsych/new-timeline`](https://github.com/jspsych/jspsych-dev/tree/main/packages/new-timeline)

Each tool can be run directly using `npx`, e.g. running `npx @jspsych/new-plugin` in the terminal. This will prompt you through the process of creating a new plugin, extension or timeline. The tool will then create a new directory in your current working directory with the appropriate files and names. More detailed instructions can be found in the `README.md` files in each of these packages.

## Contributing to jspsych-contrib or jspsych-timelines

We welcome contributions from our community!

If you would like to contribute your new plugin/extension/timeline, we highly recommend doing so by publishing your package under the `/packages` folder on one of our two community repositories âŽ¯ [jspsych-contrib](https://github.com/jspsych/jspsych-contrib) for plugins and extensions, and [jspsych-timelines](https://github.com/jspsych/jspsych-timelines) for timelines. If you plan to do so from the start, you may clone the appropriate community repository, then run the building tool (e.g. `npx @jspsych/new-plugin`) from the command line in your cloned local repository. This will automatically generate the template package under the `/packages` folder in your local repository.

When you are done with customizing your package, you can then open a pull request by pushing your changes onto a separate branch in jspsych-contrib or jspsych-timelines. Your package will then be reviewed by our team for official publishing. When published, your package will show up on the list of contributions on the repository's `README.md`, along with your name hyperlinked to your GitHub URL, if given.
